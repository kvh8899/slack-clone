# Zing

## Summary
[Zing](https://app-zing.herokuapp.com/) is a web application inspired by the popular messaging app, Slack. It gives users the ability to create a workspace that other users can join by invite. Users can then create a channel and message other users with live chat using websockets. Users can also search any user signed up on the application.

Zing allows users to:
* create an account
* log into an existing account
* log out of an account
* create/edit/delete and view workspaces
* create/edit/delete and view channels inside of workspaces
* LIVE chat for each channel
